# Welcome to the UPE Scavenger Hunt of Fall 2023!

This repository contains the clue to your first destination. There are 4 files that you will need to analyze the output of; you can either

- trace the code by viewing the files on GitHub, or
- clone the repo and run the code to see the outputs (I hope you paid attention to my Git workshop last week!)

We recommend splitting up into 4 groups, so that there are 2 or 3 people working on a file at a time!

Each file outputs a character or a string, putting them together in order of the file numbers will reveal the destination.

Good luck, and feel free to ask for help from one of the e-board members if you run into issues!
